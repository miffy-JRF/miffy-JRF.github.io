    <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>
    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
    <blockquote>"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."</blockquote>
    <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
    <p>My first day of the trip!</p>
    <p> I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. </p>
    <p>Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cellphone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just the essentials. </p>
    <p>As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
