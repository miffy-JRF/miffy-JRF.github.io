    <h1 class="font">Is ROC flag scandal-embroiled singer coming home?</h1>
    <p>That might just happen to Chou Tzu-yu, the 16-year-old Taiwanese member of the Korean girls' group Twice who became embroiled in political controversy after waving a Republic of China flag on TV.</p>
    <p>Prompted by her apology and announcement she was taking a break from all activities in the mainland Chinese market for allegedly offending fans there, Juksy, a Taiwanese pop culture news site, offered to buy her out of her contract up to 100 million New Taiwan dollars (2.98 million US dollars) and bring the singer back to Taiwan.</p>
    <p>"We're saddened and heartbroken by the political pressure faced by an inexperienced 16-year-old Taiwanese girl," Juksy said in a statement.</p>
    <p>"We've decided to stand up and give her a new possibility, a new choice."
